# Machine Learning Research Papers, Implemented

## Objective
As an undergrad student, I've often found myself floundering about the vast world of machine learning and artificial intelligence, hopping from tutorial to tutorial. While these tutorials are excellent resources for beginners, I soon realized I was in an awkward position; I had implemented fairly complex neural networks and statistical algorithms in both side and school projects, yet I was unable to follow along with most research papers.

I wanted to begin elementary-level research on a very personal level. However, in order to do this, I need to understand today's research and state-of-the-art model architectures, hence the birth of this repository.

## Structure
Research papers will be split into subdirectories, largely ordered by publication year (there may be a few misplacements or scragglers, so bear this in mind when looking for a paper). Each paper will be enclosed within its own directory, where each directory following a standard format of:
```
.
├── breakdown.md
├── model.py
└── paper.pdf
```
where the research paper itself is `paper.pdf`, the implementation (generally in PyTorch) found in `model.py`, and my personal analysis, explanation, and summarization found in `breakdown.md`.
